# hello-world

Cosmoscowboy is a noob to GitHub, hence the need for this simple repository. Hopefully at the end of this tutorial (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), I have a better knowledge of working with commits, pull requests and merging changes to the master branch. 

Now, get to work!
